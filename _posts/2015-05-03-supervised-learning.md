In supervised learning, we provide inputs and correct output values. Based on this data, the system learns to predict output values for new inputs.

#### Regression Problems

Imagine that we have a data set consisting of size of houses and their price in the real estate market. Given this data, we have to predict the market price for a new house when it's size is given. In this problem, we are predicting a real valued output.

#### Classification Problems

Let's consider the example where our data set consists of age group, location and whether they like sports. With this data, the system predicts if a particular age group in a locality likes sports. In this case, the data set is split into two classes: people who like sports and who don't.
